## Flappy Bird
This is a time pass project made in Java during the first year of Engineering. The JAVA swing has been used in this project for providing GUI.

# About
Now a days, there are many big and heavy games for playing. This project is just a trial for creating small game for time pass which can be played during your study breaks or just when you have short breaks and want to refresh your mind.
# Tech Stack
I have coded this project using JAVA, and designed its UI by JAVA Swing. This project has very minimal UI, in order to avoid complications.

Though This project can also be created by any other programming languages such as - C#,C++ or Python


# Result and How To Use
Step 1: Download the JAR file, given in the repository. Run it in your system.


Step 2: After Running the  JAR file, the Flappy Bird game will open

Step 3: You can use SPACE BAR or Your MOUSE BUTTON to navigate the birds between obstacles.

Now You Can Enjoy The Game....

# Important instruction to run this program
Install the "WindowBuilder 1.9.4" which comes with all necessary plugins needed to run this program. If the reader is using eclipse then they can simply go to the eclipse marketplace from the help menu and type in "Window Builder". It automatically takes you to this tool. Make sure you have the updated version of WindowBuilder 1.9.4.

# Conclusion
This project has been made with Java, and currently its UI have been kept extreamly simple, but few tweaks have to be made by me in UI to make this look more beautiful and appealing, the code will also be optimized a bit.
